Hello, my name is Jen and I'm a recent graduate of Dev Academy Aotearo. Over the course of nine intensive weeks, I devoted 50 hours a week to learning essential web development skills, with a focus on becoming a Frontend Developer/Designer. My skillset includes Javascript, Typescript, React, Redux and redux thunk, HTML, CSS and SASS, Rest APIs, Knex, Express, and SQL Lite. You can view a mix of personal and group projects from the Kahu Cohort 2023 on my this repo, or checkout my portfolio at https://jennifer-harper.github.io/.

Before attending Dev Academy Aotearo, I worked as a web designer, you can view my previous design work on my other GitHub profile at https://github.com/jenniferharper/ or for your aesthetic pleasure https://jenniferharper.github.io/portfolio/. I love scroll based css and javascript animations, you'll see a lot of GSAP code in this repo.
