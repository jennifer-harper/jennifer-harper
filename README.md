Hello, my name is Jen and I'm a recent graduate of Dev Academy Aotearo. Over the course of nine intensive weeks, I devoted 50 hours a week to learning essential web development skills, with a focus on becoming a Frontend Developer/Designer. My skillset includes Javascript, Typescript, React, Redux and redux thunk, HTML, CSS and SASS, Rest APIs, Knex, Express, and SQL Lite. You can view my portfolio and a mix of personal and group projects from the Kahu Cohort 2023 on my GitHub profile at https://jennifer-harper.github.io/.

Before attending Dev Academy Aotearo, I worked as a web designer, you can view my previous design work on my other GitHub profile at https://github.com/jenniferharper/ or for your aesthetic pleasure https://jenniferharper.github.io/portfolio/. I love scroll based css and javascript animations, you'll see a lot of GSAP code in this repo.

Im currently working on EVERYTHING, but mainly focusing on improving my JS, React and Redux knowledge by building out new concepts and experimenting with code. While I'm open to exploring all areas of development, my primary goal is to secure a position as a Frontend Developer/Designer. I'm eager to work collaboratively with other professionals, build awesome stuff and continue to learn.
