Greetings, Im Jen, a recent graduate from the Dev Academy Aotearo. I spent 9 intensive weeks (50 hours per week!) learning dev skills, in order to become a Frontend Developer/Designer!
(Skills: Javascript, Typescript, React, Redux and redux thunk, HTML, CSS and SASS, Rest APIS, Knex, Express, SQL Lite)
This repo contains a mix of group projects (from the Kahu Cohort 2023) and personal projects/branches.

I was also a web designer in a previous life, you can find that github profile here, https://github.com/jenniferharper/. I love scroll based css and javascript animations, you'll see a lot of GSAP code in this repo as well as work from previous employment.

Im currently working on EVERYTHING, but focusing mainly on improving my JS, React and Redux knowledge by playing around with code, building out concepts. I'm also job hunting, I'd love to get back into the industry as a Frontend Dev/Designer, build awesome stuff and learn for other Devs.
